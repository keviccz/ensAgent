**TISSUE CONTEXT**: You are analyzing human DLPFC brain tissue samples ({self.sample_display_id}) generated using the 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics platform. DLPFC is a critical cortical region involved in executive functions and working memory, characterized by distinct cortical layers (Layer 1-6) and underlying white matter. The Visium platform captures spatially-resolved gene expression at 55μm resolution spots across the tissue section. This layered architecture contains different cell types including neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia arranged in functionally distinct layers.

## Analysis Requirements:

### 1. Cross-Method Clustering Image Comparison (Focus on domain{domain_num})
Based on clustering images provided by all methods, perform cross-method comparison. Main comparison aspects include:

**Continuity Analysis:**
- Assess whether each method's clustering in domain{domain_num} is continuous
- Identify obvious breaks or discontinuous regions
- Evaluate clustering boundary clarity and completeness

**Directional Similarity:**
- Compare clustering directions of different methods in domain{domain_num}
- Assess whether methods' clustering shows similar directionality or trends
- Analyze spatial distribution patterns of clustering

**Effect Consistency:**
- Check whether different methods show consistent clustering effects in domain{domain_num}
- Identify differences in clustering morphology, density, boundaries, etc.
- Evaluate clustering result stability and reproducibility
- **Specificity Detection**: Identify abnormal methods that significantly deviate from mainstream morphology and assess their reasonableness

### 2. Analysis Combined with DLPFC Slice Knowledge
Please combine biological and anatomical knowledge of DLPFC slices:

**Biological Background:**
- DLPFC is an important brain cortical region with layered structure
- Different layers should exhibit different cell types and gene expression patterns
- Spatially adjacent cells typically have similar functional characteristics

**Anatomical Features and Expected Clustering Patterns:**
- Ideal clustering should present clear layered structure with distinct boundaries between layers
- Clustering regions should exhibit strip-like or stripe-like continuous distribution patterns
- Different clustering layers should be arranged roughly parallel, reflecting cortical hierarchical organization
- Each clustering layer should maintain relatively uniform density and continuity internally
- Clustering boundaries should be clear and smooth, avoiding over-segmentation
- **Boundary Smoothness Requirements**: Domain edges should be relatively smooth and natural
  * Jagged, serrated, or heavily irregular boundaries indicate technical quality issues
  * Natural biological boundaries should show smooth transitions rather than artificial roughness
  * Excessive edge irregularity suggests clustering algorithm limitations or parameter issues
- Spatially adjacent regions should have biological relevance
- Clustering results should avoid isolated small blocks or noise points
- Overall clustering patterns should reflect orderly spatial organizational structure
- Excellent clustering should maintain clear spatial boundaries and natural organization
- Subtle boundary changes and natural transitions should be considered as embodiments of biological reasonableness

## CRITICAL: Shape Detection Enhancement

### Mandatory Shape Verification Protocol:
1. **Individual Method Shape Assessment**:
   - Be cautious of block-like/square clusters produced by any method
   - Do NOT be misled by color clarity or boundary sharpness
   
2. **Common Shape Issues**:
   - Block-like clustering: Nearly square/rectangular domains
   - Sharp geometric boundaries: Unnatural, non-biological edges  
   - Over-regularized shapes: Too geometric, not organic layered structure
   
3. **Mandatory Cross-Method Comparison**:
   - Count shape types: Strip-like vs Block-like vs Circular
   - If a method is ONLY block-like while others are strip-like → HEAVY deduction -0.25 to -0.35
   - If a method shape differs significantly from majority → Moderate deduction -0.15 to -0.25
   
4. **Scoring Enforcement Rules**:
   - Unique shape anomaly → Mandatory deduction 0.25-0.35
   - Geometric over-regularization → Deduction 0.15-0.25
   
5. **Verification Checklist**:
   - [ ] Described GraphST specific shape features?
   - [ ] Compared GraphST shape with other methods?
   - [ ] Applied appropriate deductions for shape anomalies?
   - [ ] GraphST final score reflects shape problems?

**WARNING**: Do not be deceived by any method's color contrast or boundary clarity. Focus on SHAPE biological reasonableness!

**Strict Shape Assessment Standards:**
- **Ideal Morphology**: Strip-like, arc-shaped, parallel layered distribution, presenting continuous band-like or stripe-like structures
- **Acceptable Morphology**: Slightly curved strips, irregular but continuous layered structures
- **Problematic Morphology**: Block-like, square, circular, isolated clusters, irregular fragmented distribution
- **Serious Problems**: Complete block-like clustering, multiple isolated circular or square regions

**Specific Scoring Rules:**
- **Strip-like continuous distribution**: Normal scoring
- **Slightly irregular but maintaining strip-like shape**: Normal scoring
- **Obviously block-like/cluster-like distribution**: Deduct 0.15-0.20 points
- **Isolated circular or square regions**: Deduct 0.20-0.25 points

**Common Problem Identification (Special Attention):**
- If any domain shows "jagged boundaries" or "irregular clusters", deduct 0.15 points
- Prioritize "spatial continuity and strip-like shape" over "color vividness"
- Block-like clustering violates DLPFC cortical layered anatomical principles and must be strictly penalized

**Biological Shape Reasonableness Check:**
- DLPFC cortex should present parallel layered structure; any shape violating this principle should be penalized
- Morphology should be evaluated for biological plausibility without fixed priority ordering.
- Clustering shapes should reflect real neuroanatomical structures, not artificial geometric figures

**Cross-Method Shape Feature Assessment (Core Evaluation):**

**Shape Feature Cross-Method Comparison Process:**
1. **Overall Morphology Statistics**: Count main shape features of all 8 methods in domain{domain_num}
2. **Mainstream Morphology Identification**: Determine morphological patterns of majority (≥6 methods) as mainstream standard
3. **Abnormal Morphology Detection**: Identify abnormal methods that significantly deviate from mainstream morphology
4. **Difference Degree Quantification**: Determine deduction magnitude based on shape difference degree

**Specific Shape Comparison Rules:**

**A. When mainstream morphology is strip-like/arc-shaped (6+ methods exhibit):**
- This method is also strip-like/arc-shaped → Normal scoring, no deduction
- This method is slightly irregular strip-like → Minor deduction -0.05
- This method is obviously block-like/square → Heavy deduction -0.20 to -0.30
- This method is circular/cluster-like → Severe deduction -0.25 to -0.35

**B. When mainstream morphology is irregular but continuous (6+ methods exhibit):**
- This method is also irregular continuous → Normal scoring
- This method is regular strip-like → Minor bonus +0.05
- This method is obviously block-like → Moderate deduction -0.15 to -0.25
- This method is fragmented → Heavy deduction -0.20 to -0.30

**C. When mainstream morphology is mixed (no clear dominance):**
- This method conforms to any reasonable morphology → Normal scoring
- This method is obviously unreasonable morphology (block-like/circular) → Moderate deduction -0.10 to -0.20

**Shape Feature Identification Guide:**
- **Strip-like**: Long strip, arc-shaped, layered distribution, length-width ratio >2:1
- **Block-like**: Approximately square, rectangular, length-width ratio close to 1:1, sharp boundaries
- **Circular**: Approximately circular, elliptical clusters, tightly aggregated
- **Fragmented**: Multiple isolated small blocks, lacking continuity
- **Irregular continuous**: Irregular shape but maintaining spatial continuity

**Cross-Method Deduction Execution:**
- **Must Count First**: Clearly state "X methods exhibit strip-like, Y methods exhibit block-like"
- **Must Compare**: Clearly point out "specific differences between this method and mainstream morphology"
- **Must Deduct**: Strictly execute corresponding deductions based on difference degree
- **Must Record**: Clearly mark cross-method comparison deduction values in scoring table

**Specific Issues to Identify and Penalize:**
- **CRITICAL: Serrated/Zigzag Lines and Boundaries**: Focus on linear structure quality
  * **Serrated Lines**: Lines resembling saw teeth or zigzag patterns - deduct 0.15-0.25 points (specify: "serrated line structure -0.2 points")
  * **Jagged Linear Domains**: Domain boundaries with sharp, irregular projections - deduct 0.10-0.20 points (specify: "jagged linear boundaries -0.15 points")
  * **Line Discontinuities**: Connected lines that show breaks or interruptions - deduct 0.12-0.22 points (specify: "line discontinuity interrupts structure -0.18 points")
- **CRITICAL: Domain Adjacency Pattern Assessment**: Analyze spatial neighboring relationships
  * **Adjacency Analysis Protocol**:
    1. Identify which domains are adjacent to this domain{domain_num} (above, below, left, right sides)
    2. Count adjacency patterns across all 8 methods: "X methods show domain{domain_num} adjacent to domainY above, Z methods show domainA below"
    3. Determine mainstream adjacency pattern (≥5 methods showing same pattern)
    4. Apply deductions for methods deviating from mainstream adjacency
  * **Adjacency Deviation Penalties**:
    - **Major Adjacency Deviation**: Missing mainstream adjacent domain - deduct 0.15-0.25 points (specify: "domain{domain_num} lacks adjacent domain3 above while 6+ methods have it -0.2 points")
    - **Moderate Adjacency Deviation**: Different adjacent domain than mainstream - deduct 0.10-0.18 points (specify: "domain{domain_num} connects to domain5 above while mainstream connects to domain3 -0.15 points")
    - **Minor Adjacency Inconsistency**: Partial adjacency mismatch - deduct 0.08-0.12 points (specify: "partial adjacency deviation from mainstream pattern -0.1 points")
  * **Adjacency Consistency Requirement**: Must explicitly state "Domain{domain_num} adjacency: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, consistent/inconsistent with mainstream pattern"
- **Cross-Method Domain Splitting Assessment**: Compare domain splitting patterns across all methods
  * If this method shows unique domain splitting that other methods don't have: deduct 0.15-0.25 points
  * If majority of methods (6+ methods) show similar splitting: no deduction for splitting
  * Must specify: "unique domain splitting compared to other methods -0.2 points" or "splitting consistent with other methods, no deduction"

**Special Attention:**
- If a method is the only block-like/circular while other 7 are strip-like → Must heavily deduct
- If a method's boundary direction is completely opposite to other methods → Must moderately deduct
- If a method's continuity is obviously inferior to other methods → Must lightly deduct
- Cross-method comparison deduction is mandatory and cannot be exempted due to other advantages

### 3. Scoring and Ranking
Based on cross-method comparison and DLPFC slice knowledge:

**CRITICAL: WEIGHTED SCORING SYSTEM (0-1 points):**

**Each method's TOTAL SCORE must be calculated as:**
**TOTAL = (Continuity × 0.3) + (Biological_Reasonableness × 0.3) + (Technical_Quality × 0.4)**

**Scoring Components:**

    - **Fragmented Linear Structures**: If continuous lines become fragmented - deduct 0.15-0.25 points (specify: "fragmented line structure -0.2 points")
    - **Complete Line Interruption**: If entire linear domains are broken - deduct 0.20-0.30 points (specify: "complete line interruption -0.25 points")
  * **MANDATORY**: Must specify exact deduction reasons (e.g., "central domain discontinuity -0.15 points", "line breaks in strip structure -0.18 points")
  * Rate this component on 0-1 scale FIRST
  * This score will be MULTIPLIED by 0.3 in final calculation
  
- **Biological Reasonableness (0.3 weight)**: Degree of conformity with DLPFC anatomical structure, **strictly assess shape reasonableness and cross-method consistency**
  * **MANDATORY**: Must specify exact deduction reasons for shape issues:
    - Strip-like/band-like morphology: Normal scoring (specify why: "strip-like matches layer structure")

    - Isolated circular/square regions: Deduct 0.20-0.25 (specify: "isolated circular regions violate biology -0.25 points")
  * **Cross-method comparison shape deduction (mandatory execution with reasons)**:

    - Obviously inconsistent: Deduct 0.15-0.25 (specify: "only block-like method while others strip-like -0.2 points")
    - Severely inconsistent: Deduct 0.25-0.35 (specify exact morphology difference)
  * **MANDATORY**: Each deduction must cite specific morphology observations
  * Rate this component on 0-1 scale FIRST
  * This score will be MULTIPLIED by 0.3 in final calculation
  
- **Technical Quality (0.4 weight)**: Clustering boundary clarity, spatial organization quality, overall clustering precision
  * **MANDATORY**: Must specify exact deduction reasons for technical issues:
    - Noise/precision problems (specify: "excessive noise points in upper domain -0.05 points", "clustering imprecision -0.1 points")
    - **CRITICAL: Linear Edge Quality Assessment**: Evaluate line smoothness and regularity
      * **Serrated/Zigzag Lines**: Lines with tooth-like, saw-toothed patterns - deduct 0.15-0.25 points (specify: "serrated line patterns -0.2 points")
      * **Jagged Line Segments**: Linear structures with sharp, irregular protrusions - deduct 0.10-0.20 points (specify: "jagged line segments -0.15 points")
      * **Rough Linear Boundaries**: Unsmooth, bumpy line edges - deduct 0.08-0.15 points (specify: "rough linear boundaries -0.12 points")
      * **Fragmented Line Patterns**: Broken, discontinuous linear edges - deduct 0.15-0.25 points (specify: "fragmented line patterns -0.2 points")
      * Smooth, natural linear boundaries: Normal scoring
    - Spatial organization issues (specify: "disorganized spatial structure -0.1 points", "insufficient clustering precision -0.1 points")
    - Domain adjacency problems (specify: "domain{domain_num} adjacency deviates from mainstream pattern -0.15 points", "missing expected adjacent domains -0.2 points")
    - Noise/precision problems (specify exact locations and severity)
  * Focus on boundary definition, spatial coherence, and clustering precision without considering color factors
  * **MANDATORY**: Each deduction must cite specific technical observations including edge quality
  * Rate this component on 0-1 scale FIRST  
  * This score will be MULTIPLIED by 0.4 in final calculation

**MANDATORY CALCULATION EXAMPLE:**
Method X: Continuity=0.8, Biological=0.6, Technical=0.9
TOTAL = (0.8 × 0.3) + (0.6 × 0.3) + (0.9 × 0.4) = 0.24 + 0.18 + 0.36 = 0.78

**Ranking Requirements:**

- **Final Score**: X.XXX (after deductions)

**CRITICAL: MULTI-REGION DOMAIN ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**

**Step 1: Domain Region Identification**
- **Region Detection**: First identify if domain{domain_num} appears as a single continuous region or multiple separate regions
  * If single continuous region: Proceed with standard analysis
  * If multiple separate regions: **MANDATORY** to analyze each region individually
- **Region Naming Convention**: Label each region clearly (e.g., "Region A", "Region B", "Region C")
- **Region Count Documentation**: State total number of distinct regions (e.g., "domain{domain_num} appears in 3 separate regions")

**Step 2: Individual Region Analysis (For Each Separate Region)**
- **Regional Morphology Assessment**: Analyze each region's shape, size, and biological appropriateness independently
  * Region A: Shape characteristics, size, biological plausibility
  * Region B: Shape characteristics, size, biological plausibility  
  * Region C: Shape characteristics, size, biological plausibility
- **Regional Continuity Evaluation**: Assess continuity within each individual region
  * Internal continuity of Region A: Line breaks, fragmentation within the region
  * Internal continuity of Region B: Line breaks, fragmentation within the region
  * Internal continuity of Region C: Line breaks, fragmentation within the region
- **Regional Adjacency Analysis**: Determine neighboring domains for each region separately
  * Region A adjacency: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, Left=domainZ, Right=domainW
  * Region B adjacency: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, Left=domainZ, Right=domainW
  * Region C adjacency: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, Left=domainZ, Right=domainW

**Step 3: Multi-Region Integration Assessment**
- **Cross-Regional Consistency**: Compare morphology and characteristics between different regions of the same domain
  * Are all regions morphologically consistent? (e.g., all strip-like vs mixed shapes)
  * Do regions show similar biological appropriateness?
  * Are regional adjacency patterns logically consistent?
- **Fragmentation Impact Evaluation**: Assess how multi-region distribution affects overall domain quality
  * Minor fragmentation (2-3 well-organized regions): Minor deduction -0.05 to -0.10
  * Moderate fragmentation (4-5 scattered regions): Moderate deduction -0.10 to -0.18
  * Severe fragmentation (6+ disconnected regions): Major deduction -0.18 to -0.25
  * Random scattered distribution: Heavy deduction -0.25 to -0.35

**MANDATORY DOMAIN ADJACENCY ANALYSIS (For Each Method):**
- **Adjacent Domain Identification**: Clearly state which domains are adjacent to domain{domain_num} in this method
  * **For Single Region**: Above: domain_X, Below: domain_Y, Left: domain_Z, Right: domain_W
  * **For Multiple Regions**: List adjacency for each region separately:
    - Region A: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, Left=domainZ, Right=domainW
    - Region B: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, Left=domainZ, Right=domainW
    - Region C: Above=domainX, Below=domainY, Left=domainZ, Right=domainW
- **Cross-Method Adjacency Comparison**: Compare this method's adjacency pattern with other methods
  * State mainstream pattern: "6+ methods show domain{domain_num} adjacent to domain3 above and domain5 below"
  * Identify deviations: "This method shows domain{domain_num} adjacent to domain2 above (deviates from mainstream domain3)"
  * For multi-region cases: Compare each region's adjacency with mainstream single-region pattern
- **Adjacency Scoring Impact**: Apply appropriate deductions for adjacency pattern deviations
  * Consistent with mainstream: "adjacency pattern consistent, no deduction"
  * Deviates from mainstream: "adjacency deviation causes -0.XX points deduction"
  * Multi-region penalty: Additional deduction for fragmentation as specified above

| Method Name| 0.xx (specific deduction reason) | 0.xx (specific deduction reason) | 0.xx (specific deduction reason) | (0.xx×0.3)+(0.xx×0.3)+(0.xx×0.4) | -0.xx | 0.xxx | x |

**CRITICAL**: Each score MUST be accompanied by specific deduction reasons in parentheses.

**CRITICAL TABLE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Continuity**: Raw score (0-1) for continuity assessment  
- **Bio.Reason**: Raw score (0-1) for biological reasonableness
- **Tech.Quality**: Raw score (0-1) for technical quality
- **Weighted Calc**: SHOW the weighted calculation formula: (Continuity×0.3)+(Bio.Reason×0.3)+(Tech.Quality×0.4)
- **Cross-Method Deduction**: Additional deductions for shape inconsistency with mainstream
- **Final Score**: Weighted total MINUS cross-method deductions
- **Rank**: Final ranking based on Final Score

**Table Description:**
- All raw component scores must be on 0-1 scale
- Weighted Calc column must show the mathematical formula being applied
- Cross-Method Deduction: Shows points deducted due to shape features inconsistent with mainstream
- Final Score: Weighted calculation result after deducting cross-method comparison deductions
- If no cross-method comparison deduction, this column shows "0.00"

**Important Reminders:**
- **Cross-method comparison is a core requirement**: Must first count shape features of all methods, then conduct individual assessments
- **Mandatory deduction mechanism execution**: Methods inconsistent with mainstream morphology must be penalized, no exemptions allowed
- **Shape difference quantification**: Must clearly explain specific degree of difference between each method and mainstream morphology
- **Deduction transparency**: Must display specific numerical values of cross-method comparison deductions in scoring table
- Emphasize biological plausibility; penalize clearly non-biological/geometric shapes; avoid fixed morphology priority
- **Consistency verification**: Ensure methods with similar shape problems receive similar deductions
- **Assessment Process**: 
  1. Count shape feature distribution of 8 methods
  2. Determine mainstream morphological patterns (≥6 methods)
  3. Identify abnormal methods and quantify differences
  4. Execute corresponding deductions and record reasons

Please ensure analysis is objective and professional, conduct scientific assessment based on image content, and every method must have clear numerical scoring."""
